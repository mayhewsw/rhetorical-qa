# Rhetorical Question Answering

Prior work in Question Answering has focused primarily on questions that can be answered.
    But this leads to unusual behavior when a user asks a question with no answer, commonly
    referred to as a rhetorical question. There are two major open problems in the area of
    Rhetorical Question Answering (RQA): 1) detecting rhetorical questions, and 2) answering them appropriately.
    We leave the former problem to future work, and focus on the latter. What could go wrong?
